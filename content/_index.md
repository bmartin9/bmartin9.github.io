        The theme of my PhD research is network time series. In particular I am interested in settings in which the data dimension is comparable to or greater than the number of observations. Tools from high dimensional statistics are required in this setting; for example: dimensionality reduction, factor models, sparse regression via penalisation, and network based approaches.
