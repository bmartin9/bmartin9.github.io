    # summary: |
      # I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## About Me

I am a PhD student on the Statistics and Machine Learning (StatML) Center for Doctoral Training between Imperial College London and the University of Oxford. My research interests include network based methods for high dimensional time series with applications to finance. Previously, I studied mathematical physics at the University of Edinburgh and the University of California, Berkeley.
